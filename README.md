# BatTool

This R package was developed to help the USFWS understand the effects of wind turbine mortality and WNS on the Indiana bat. The model has been described in a <a href = "http://www.scfbm.org/content/9/1/9">peer-reviewd </a> (and open access publication). The package includes both a GUI and command line interface. The GUI only works for <i>Myotis</i> spp., although the command line tool has been expanded for two other genera of bats: <i>Lasiurus</i> spp. and <i>Pipistrelle</i> spp. 

Please see the Readme text file for instillation directions.

# Known bugs
Demographic stochasticity currently only works for the <i>Myotis</i> spp.
